You are given 3 glasses with their respective capacities (volumes) stored in an array cap. It is possible to perform either of the two following operations to the glasses:

empty one of the glasses entirely;
pour water from one glass into another until either the first one is empty or the second one is full.
Initially all the glasses are full (i.e. for each valid i the ith glass has cap[i] units of water). How many different positive volumes of the total amount of water in all the glasses is it possible to get performing an arbitrary number of described actions?

Example

For cap = [1, 1, 1], the output should be
threeGlasses(cap) = 3.
Initially there are 3 units of water in all the glasses. The only action you can perform is to empty the water from one of the glasses, which will leave you with 2 units. At this point, pouring water from one glass to another won't produce a different total amount of water, so the only remaining option is emptying one of the remaining glasses, which will leave you with 1 final unit of water. Thus, it is possible to obtain 1, 2 or 3 units of water, so the answer is 3.

For cap = [16, 5, 3], the output should be
threeGlasses(cap) = 21.
Here is the list of all possible amounts of water across all three glasses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24.

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py)
[input] array.integer cap

Individual capacity of each glass (their volume), listed as three positive integers.

Constraints:
1 ≤ cap[i] ≤ 100.

[output] integer

The number of different positive total volumes.
