problem description (paraphrased from google's):

a company has a known number of levels of supervision x, i.e. the number of steps in the chain of command, and each individual employee may have a maximum of 7 employees under their supervision. each employee has one supervisor. there is one "CEO" at the top of the hierarchy who has no supervisor and who may also have no more than 7 employees reporting to him directly. write a function which is given the number of levels of supervision, x, as a parameter and returns the maximum possible number of employees. for example, if given 1 it should return 8, because with one level of supervision there is the CEO and his (max) 7 employees. if given 2, the function should return 57 - the CEO (+1), his seven employees (+7), and their 7 employees each (+49) --  1 + 7 + 49 = 57.

test case will be a positive integer between 1 and 10
